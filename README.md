# Adventure-Works-Dashboard

AdventureWorks is a widely-used sample database that simulates a fictional bicycle and accessory manufacturing company.This data comes from Maven Analytics and is hypothetical. The data was stored in 8 separate tables, with 56,046 rows of sales data, 1,809 rows of returns data and 293 rows of product data. Tables include - calender, customer, sales, returns, product, product category, product sub-category & territory.

In this project, I leveraged Power BI to effectively visualize the sales and returns data of Adventure Works, a fictional bike shop. My primary focus for this particular project was to serve as a learning opportunity for honing visualization and analysis techniques. At the onset of the project, I initiated the process by connecting to and shaping the data, focusing on data quality assurance to ensure accuracy. Navigating the Power BI query editor for the first time presented a steep learning curve, requiring attention to detail to get the tables organized and aligned. Then, I created data model which gave me an oppurtunity to undestand more about relational models and cardinality. I have also created many new columns and measure using DAX. I also tired to explore various other features on Power BI such as decomposition tree, key influencers etc.

The entire dashboard is divided 4 parts:
1) Excecutive Summary --> High level summary of the data
2) Map --> An excellent way to gain insights into using geospatial data and tooltips.
3) Product Details --> contains all product details and product specific KPIs.
4) Customer Details --> contains all customers details and customer specific KPIs.

By conducting a thorough analysis of the AdventureWorks database, I have acquired valuable insights into trends in sales, customer behavior, and the performance of products.
